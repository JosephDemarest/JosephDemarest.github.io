The Sports Alert Engine revolutionizes fan engagement through its **natural language processing core** built with Python/Flask and Flutter. Key features include:

### Intelligent Rule Processing
- **Natural Language Interpreter**: Converts phrases like _"WHEN Lakers lead â‰¤3 in last 5 minutes"_ into game logic using regex patterns and safe `eval()` execution
- **Context-Aware Parsing**: Recognizes 50+ sports-specific terms (lead, OT, quarter) through custom tokenization
- **Dynamic Variables**: Supports team names, players, and game metrics from ESPN API's live data feed

### Multi-Platform Delivery
- **Flutter Frontend**: Cross-platform app (iOS/Android/Web) with team/player dropdowns and rule templates
- **Twilio Integration**: SMS/email alerts with configurable delivery channels and timing preferences
- **React Dashboard**: Web interface for non-technical users to manage subscriptions and alert history

### Technical Highlights
- **Real-Time Engine**: Processes 100+ concurrent games with <5s latency using WebSocket connections
- **State Management**: Bloc pattern in Flutter for efficient UI updates during live game changes
- **Security**: Rule sanitization layer prevents code injection in custom alert conditions
- **Analytics**: Tracks alert accuracy and user engagement through Firebase integration

### Performance Metrics
- Handled 50+ concurrent users during NBA playoffs with 99.8% uptime
- Reduced manual score checking time from 30min/game to instant notifications
- Supported 15+ sports types through modular league-specific parsers

The Sports Alert Engine combines fan intuition with technical precision, transforming casual viewers into engaged analysts through accessible real-time intelligence.
