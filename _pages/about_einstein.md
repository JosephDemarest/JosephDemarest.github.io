I’m a multidisciplinary engineer who thrives at the intersection of software development, embedded electronics, and 3D printing. Drawing on open-source tools and frameworks, I’ve built solutions that cut analysis times from hours to minutes, saved significant costs through custom PCB designs, and boosted research throughput by orders of magnitude. My approach combines creativity with practical engineering.

I believe in the power of open-source collaboration to spark fresh ideas and tackle tough challenges. I’m also committed to perpetual learning—constantly exploring new technologies and techniques to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving field. Above all, I’m passionate about making a tangible impact: I love transforming interdisciplinary concepts into real-world applications that push innovation forward.
